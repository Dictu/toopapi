API for TOOP applications. Needs to be build before toopnode and demotoop projects.

# First of all #
This project depends on:
- JDK 8
- Apache Maven 3x (https://maven.apache.org/)
- Lombok (https://projectlombok.org)

All three need to be installed, configured and running properly.

Note that 8 is in use here due to the fact that provide-node-se requires Java8.
